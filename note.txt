Title: BOLD: Bayesian Online Liar Detector via Ethereum Smart Contract Mechanism

CHECKLIST!!

[1] supervise learning - non- deep learning
- Understand the LIAR dataset
- read the Wang paper- liar liar pants on fire
- fix the jenky sklearn code
- get the appropriate results for acc, f1-score, prediction etc
- receive better results, eg: graphs, distribution, convolution matrix

[2] web framework
- create a flask based site
- setup SQL
- get/post command
- get good results (showing that the algorithm is learning etc)

[3] BDNN ALGORITHM
- create BDNN (bayesian deep NN) alg (pseudocode)??
- implement the BDNN alg with tensorflow
- get highest qulaity acc on LIAR dataset ---- this is the most important
  result!!!
- define the alg and the architecture
- math model be defined

[4] BOLD archtiecture
- create a novel arch. that comprises ethereum smart contract
with BDNN alg
- sample implementation result
- BOLD arch. diagram is required
- future work in the area
