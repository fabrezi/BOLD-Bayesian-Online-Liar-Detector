# BOLD-Bayesian-Online-Liar-Detector
We develop a Bayesian Neural Network algorithm to predict whether the text corpus is true or fake content. There is a link that leads to BOLD webpage for real- time testing. 
This is part of reasearch thesis work.
Try it out. Have fun.

the model has updated. I am using BERT model instead of Bayesian.

Cheers!!
