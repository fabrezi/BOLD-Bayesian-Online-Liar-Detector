ITS A MIGHTY PRETTY BERT.

ok. so this is a classification test to see if the BERT model does any good on the LIAR Dataset. it is a dataset made by Politifact. 
Further there is an implementation of smart contract for verification test module.

This is part of reasearch thesis work.
Try it out. Have fun.

the model has updated. I am using BERT model instead of Bayesian.
